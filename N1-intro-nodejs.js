<!-- c req s for website eg : google.com 
s sends the ws in form of html , css and js , {inbrowser js }
and the js in the backend is backend js -- which will be executed in js  -->
 

<!-- what is nodejs actually ?  
browser executes the js 
scalable too - 1 se 1000 users at a time easy 
open source 
run js on server
all rounder ( front end and backend too ) 
supports multiple 

many famouse companies use it 
usefull inbuilt modules - importable codes  
is fast in nature ! -->

<!-- telusko - nodejs intro 
in order for the browser to understand the langauage of js 
it need to be converted into machine code using the js engine {chrome, mozilla firefox etcs   -- vs search enghin of chrome 
bc it convert code to machine language }

run time environment where we can run js -- instead of running it in browser 
expresss js is the framework for developing the web applications 
eg : java has spring and python has django to build web appln 

after installing the nodejs and everthing said in the video 
go to terminal and type -- node 

now we can write the js code like we use to do in the console of browser 

> const a = 100
> console.log(a)
op -- 100 

now -- L63.js file made and write the code of hello world suing console log 

and run it in terminal using run symbol present 

if it dont run use node .\L63.js

maza nhi aya bro -- nodejs has given us code in their ws in about us , just copy paste and run 

op will be giving a https
click on it and will retrun the op as helloworld - server bana diya   contratulations !!
